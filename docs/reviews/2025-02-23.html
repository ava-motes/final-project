            Review by Ava Motes, <span>White Lotus Weekly</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            This episode ran a little tamer than I expected. It feels like we’re
            still in the midst of the set-up part of the plot, waiting to learn
            more about each of these characters. I’m still enjoying seeing their
            character development, but I’m hoping this isn’t too slow of a burn.
          </p>

          <p>
            As predicted, tensions are building within the group of girl
            friends. Jaclyn and Kate are trash-talking Laurie, and Laurie and
            Kate are trash-talking Jaclyn. I wonder who will be on the outs
            next… It may not come as much of a surprise, but I will say that I
            think the scripting is just perfect — delivered by hushed voices
            behind fake smiles. Their interactions feel very real to me, like I
            know these women. I can’t quite tell who to feel sorry for. At
            first, I thought Laurie was a clear punching bag, but now I’m not so
            sure. She’s a bit of a hater in a way that just doesn’t sit right
            with me. There’s not a definitive answer to which is worse between
            kicking someone while they’re down or resenting someone while
            they’re up. It’s all disappointing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think we start to get more of a sense of where Mike White is going
            in this session during Rick’s mediation session with Amrita, who
            works at the White Lotus. He opens up about his traumatic childhood,
            and she encourages him to look inward. He doesn’t seem to quite take
            to these lessons in the way he probably needs to, which I could
            imagine might be his undoing later on. Wellness is clearly a thread
            throughout this season, but many of these characters don’t seem
            interested in taking the proper steps to attain that wellness. It
            takes more than booking an expensive vacation and a massage.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the biggest climaxes of this episode is when two men rob the
            hotel boutique, and Chelsea is almost caught in the cross-fire. Rick
            seems completely inept at comforting her, which just reaffirms how
            one-sided I feel their relationship is. Chelsea takes it like a
            champ, but she deserves so much better. Rick even tells Chelsea he’s
            leaving for Bangkok to track down Sritala’s husband, turning a
            moment that should be about comforting her into a further descent
            into his own pain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Things also remain tense with the Ratliffs as Timothy’s phone
            continues blowing up, Saxon makes crude comments about Piper’s sex
            life, and Victoria is simply sticking out like a sore thumb. I’m
            living for her because her accent is hilarious, but she definitely
            doesn’t seem like she’s learning any lessons this season. I’m
            curious to see if everything will fall apart for Timothy during the
            trip, or if he’ll manage to fend off reporters and allegations until
            the end of their stay.
          </p>

          <p>
            What I’m most excited about in the next episode is learning more
            about Greg-Gary, especially after Belinda clocks him. Is she going
            to realize he killed Tonya? What will she do? I’m dying to know.
            Hopefully we're not in suspense much longer, but I wouldn’t be
            surprised if we were.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’d give this episode a 7/10. I’m still on the hook, but am curious
            to see if things are going to pick up with the staff at the resort,
            what Rick is planning, what’s happening with Greg-Gary, etcetera.
            We’re going to need some more kernels to that effect next week!
