              <p class="card-text">
                Chelsea is an optimistic, wide-eyed and free-spirited woman who
                is traveling with her on-edge, older boyfriend Rick. Though she
                appears to be a romantic at heart, her positive view of the
                relationship appears to be a bit one-sided, with Rick investing
                much less in her than she does in him. Though it&#39;s a little
                frustrating to watch, she&#39;s so genuinely sweet that
                she&#39;s impossible not to like. I could see myself being
                friends with this girl (albeit, I might be constantly telling
                her to dump him). But she feels normal, kind, open-hearted, and
                undeserving of whatever misfortune is about to befall the guests
                at the resort. Most people don&#39;t leave the White Lotus
                happy---not even the fan favorites.

              <p class="card-text">
                Victoria is the matriarch of the Ratliff family, and she can
                only be described as a hoot. I would probably find her comments
                insufferable in real life, but she absolutely steals the show in
                the season. I think we really needed the added humor she brings,
                especially now that Tonya has been killed off. Every single time
                she&#39;s on screen, she steals the show and cracks me up. That
                being said, she is fully too rich for her own good and the
                perfect example of the kind of person this show is making a
                commentary against.

                I liked Laurie a lot from episode 1. She&#39;s a third of the
                group of women on the girl&#39;s trip, and she feels a bit
                estranged from the others. I really respect her as a
                hard-working attorney and single mom, and I wish her friends
                weren&#39;t delighting so much in her misfortune. She&#39;s a
                bit of a gossip and she can be kind of judgmental, so she&#39;s
                far from perfect. However, I feel like I really get her
                character and could also imagine knowing her in real life.
                She&#39;s fun, she&#39;s honest, and she seems a lot less
                materialistic than the other people around her. I like the
                complexity her character has, and I&#39;m interested to see
                where she goes.

              </h6>
              <p class="card-text">
                I was very excited to see Belinda, the spa manager for the White
                Lotus Maui, return from season 1. She&#39;s an all-around
                pure-hearted character, who is gracious and kind. I&#39;m so
                here for her fling with Pornchai, and I hope she makes it out of
                this season unscathed. I do worry that she&#39;ll meet the same
                fate as Tonya after Greg-Gary clocks that she&#39;s there, but
                maybe she&#39;ll be spared as a solid fan-favorite character. My
                only con with Belinda is I think her character can feel a little
                flat at times, especially in previous seasons. I&#39;m curious
                to see if we&#39;ll get to understand more of the tension
                she&#39;s dealing with in Thailand.

              <p class="card-text">
                Frank is SO entertaining. We&#39;re introduced to him in a
                loungey bar in Bankok, where he meets Rick ahead of his
                potentially disasterous mission to avenge his father&#39;s
                death. He launches into a monologue about his motivations for
                moving to Thailand, his sex life and desires, and his general
                psychoanalysis of himself. Love a self-aware king. Frank may be
                a freak, but he&#39;s also introspective and knows exactly who
                he is. He&#39;s tackeld his demons, it seems, and wants to try
                to lead a healthier, sober life. I honestly think he&#39;s
                someone Rick could learn from --- that is, if Rick doesn&#39;t
                completely screw him over.

                Sritala is such a talent, and I love the respect that she
                commands on screen. As the owner of the White Lotus (alongside
                her husband, Jim), she is the real lady in charge. She can sing,
                act, and turn a look. She might be a bit vain, and even blinded
                by her vanity in the sense that she allows Rick to manipulat
                her, but I still think she&#39;s great. I wish she had more
                screen time.

                Saxon probably would have been last on my list after episode 1,
                but I started feeling sorry for him as the season progressed. He
                doesn&#39;t really know who he is or what he values outside of
                this hegemonic framework of masculinity, which is ultimately
                pretty empty for him. Though he talks a big game about taking
                advantage of people and beign owed something from women, she
                also finds himself in the position of beign violated
                unexpectedly, and I think it&#39;s a revelation for him.
                He&#39;s so far from perfect, but his character is really
                interesting and I think there&#39;s some potential for him to
                grow after his stay at the White Lotus.

                the first episode, but I honestly feel really sorry for him too.
                I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s sweet or just an act of
                self-preservation that he doesn&#39;t tell his family what&#39;s
                waiting for them at home after this trip. It does allow them to
                have this &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; kind of experience,
                though. It&#39;s really hard watching him lose his mind, and I
                am kind of rooting for him to figure things out in a weird way.

                The tables really do turn. I went from feeling sorry for Lochlan
                to just being entirely unsure what to think. I can&#39;t forgive
                a character doing anything unconsensual sexually. There are a
                lot of reasons why he&#39;s messed up himself, but he just
                leaves me a bit uncomfortable. That said, I do think he&#39;s a
                lot less high maitenance and outwardly frustrating than some
                other characters lower on my list.

                Gaitok also drives me crazy. He&#39;s sweet, but he just keeps

                be the reason someone else does. I wish we could see a little
                more character development from him. His life is pretty much his
                job and his crush on Mook --- who really doesn&#39;t seem very
                interested, and I think he probably needs to give it up. I wish
                his storyline was a bit more interesting.

                understand why her character is so underdeveloped. Does anyone
                else notice that we never see her without Gaitok? She&#39;s only
                ever presented through his gaze, and we don&#39;t know a think
                about her that he doesn&#39;t also see. It just feels a little
                like lazy writing to me.

                potential love itnerest to Belinda, and we never get to see him
                apart from his interactions with her. I think this happens so
                much this season because there are simply too many characters
                packed in. I would have loved to see the writers hone in on a
                smaller act of characters and really let their stories
