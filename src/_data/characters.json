      "rank": 1,
      "name": "Chelsea",
      "actor": "Aimee Lou Wood",
      "reasoning": "Chelsea is an optimistic, wide-eyed and free-spirited woman who is traveling with her on-edge, older boyfriend Rick. Though she appears to be a romantic at heart, her positive view of the relationship appears to be a bit one-sided, with Rick investing much less in her than she does in him. Though it's a little frustrating to watch, she's so genuinely sweet that she's impossible not to like. I could see myself being friends with this girl (albeit, I might be constantly telling her to dump him). But she feels normal, kind, open-hearted, and undeserving of whatever misfortune is about to befall the guests at the resort. Most people don't leave the White Lotus happy---not even the fan favorites. ",

      "rank": 2,
      "name": "Victoria Ratliff",
      "actor": "Parker Posey",
      "reasoning": "Victoria is the matriarch of the Ratliff family, and she can only be described as a hoot. I would probably find her comments insufferable in real life, but she absolutely steals the show in the season. I think we really needed the added humor she brings, especially now that Tonya has been killed off. Every single time she's on screen, she steals the show and cracks me up. That beign said, she is fully too rich for her own good and the perfect example of the kind of person this show is making a commentary against.",

    {
      "rank": 3,
      "name": "Laurie",
      "actor": "Carrie Coon",
      "reasoning": "I liked Laurie a lot from episode 1. She's a third of the group of women on the girl's trip, and she feels a bit estranged from the others. I really respect her as a hard-working attorney and single mom, and I wish her friends weren't delighting so much in her misfortune. She's a bit of a gossip and she can be kind of judgmental, so she's far from perfect. However, I feel like I really get her character and could also imagine knowing her in real life. She's fun, she's honest, and she seems a lot less materialistic than the other people around her. I like the complexity her character has, and I'm interested to see where she goes.",

    {
      "rank": 4,
      "name": "Belinda",
      "actor": "Natasha Rothwell",
      "reasoning": "I was very excited to see Belinda, the spa manager for the White Lotus Maui, return from season 1. She's an all-around pure-hearted character, who is gracious and kind. I'm so here for her fling with Pornchai, and I hope she makes it out of this season unscathed. I do worry that she'll meet the same fate as Tonya after Greg-Gary clocks that she's there, but maybe she'll be spared as a solid fan-favorite character. My only con with Belinda is I think her character can feel a little flat at times, especially in previous seasons. I'm curious to see if we'll get to understand more of the tension she's dealing with in Thailand.",

      "rank": 5,
      "name": "Frank",
      "actor": "Sam Rockwell",
      "reasoning": "Frank is SO entertaining. We're introduced to him in a loungey bar in Bankok, where he meets Rick ahead of his potentially disasterous mission to avenge his father's death. He launches into a monologue about his motivations for moving to Thailand, his sex life and desires, and his general psychoanalysis of himself. Love a self-aware king. Frank may be a freak, but he's also introspective and knows exactly who he is. He's tackeld his demons, it seems, and wants to try to lead a healthier, sober life. I honestly think he's someone Rick could learn from --- that is, if Rick doesn't completely screw him over.",

      "rank": 6,
      "name": "Sritala Hollinger",
      "actor": "Patravadi Mejudhon/Lek Patravadi",
      "reasoning": "Sritala is such a talent, and I love the respect that she commands on screen. As the owner of the White Lotus (alongside her husband, Jim), she is the real lady in charge. She can sing, act, and turn a look. She might be a bit vain, and even blinded by her vanity in the sense that she allows Rick to manipulat her, but I still think she's great. I wish she had more screen time.",

      "rank": 7,
      "name": "Saxon Ratliff",
      "actor": "Patrick Schwarzenegger",
      "reasoning": "Saxon probably would have been last on my list after episode 1, but I started feeling sorry for him as the season progressed. He doesn't really know who he is or what he values outside of this hegemonic framework of masculinity, which is ultimately pretty empty for him. Though he talks a big game about taking advantage of people and beign owed something from women, she also finds himself in the position of beign violated unexpectedly, and I think it's a revelation for him. He's so far from perfect, but his character is really interesting and I think there's some potential for him to grow after his stay at the White Lotus. ",

      "rank": 8,
      "name": "Timothy Ratliff",
      "actor": "Jason Isaacs",
      "reasoning": "Timothy is another character I would have really despised after the first episode, but I honestly feel really sorry for him too. I can't tell if it's sweet or just an act of self-preservation that he doesn't tell his family what's waiting for them at home after this trip. It does allow them to have this \"ignorance is bliss\" kind of experience, though. It's really hard watching him lose his mind, and I am kind of rooting for him to figure things out in a weird way.",

      "rank": 9,
      "name": "Lochlan Ratliff",
      "actor": "Sam Nivola",
      "reasoning": "The tables really do turn. I went from feeling sorry for Lochlan to just being entirely unsure what to think. I can't forgive a character doing anything unconsensual sexually. There are a lot of reasons why he's messed up himself, but he just leaves me a bit uncomfortable. That said, I do think he's a lot less high maitenance and outwardly frustrating than some other characters lower on my list.",

      "rank": 10,
      "name": "Rick",
      "actor": "Walton Goggins",
      "reasoning": "Rick just makes me mad. He can't appreciate what he has, and his choices are just evry illogical. He puts himself before everyone else, every time. It's not sustainable. The fact that he can't show an ounce of concern for Chelsea --- espeically after the danger he directly puts her in --- just makes me mad. I haven't liked him from day one. I do like Walton Goggins, though.",

      "name": "Gaitok",
      "actor": "Tayme Thapthimthong",
      "reasoning": "Gaitok also drives me crazy. He's sweet, but he just keeps messing up in really crucial ways. I feel like he might die or be the reason someone else does. I wish we could see a little more character development from him. His life is pretty much his job and his crush on Mook --- who really doesn't seem very interested, and I think he probably needs to give it up. I wish his storyline was a bit more interesting.",

      "name": "Mook",
      "actor": "Lalisa Manobal",
      "reasoning": "The disapointment I feel with Gaitok's storyline is only amplified with Mook. Lalisa is very famous, so I don't understand why her character is so underdeveloped. Does anyone else notice that we never see her without Gaitok? She's only ever presented through his gaze, and we don't know a think about her that he doesn't also see. It just feels a little like lazy writing to me.",

      "rank": 13,
      "name": "Pornchai",
      "actor": "Dom Hetrakul",
      "reasoning": "Pornchai is very sweet, but he has a similar character development issue as Mook. He's really just there as a potential love itnerest to Belinda, and we never get to see him apart from his interactions with her. I think this happens so much this season because there are simply too many characters packed in. I would have loved to see the writers hone in on a smaller act of characters and really let their stories percolate.",

      "actor": "Charlotte Le Bon",
      "reasoning": "How are you going to be partying right after your so-called bestie dies? This is truthfully a perspective from further ahead in the season, but she just makes me so mad for that. I will give her some credit for getting her bag, though, and she does seem kind of fun. ",

      "name": "Kate",
      "actor": "Leslie Bib",
      "reasoning": "Kate is the second third in our girl-group, and she is such a believable Austin-transplant. I feel like I definitely know this woman, and I don't have great things to say. She's an \"independent,\" right? I'll give her some bonus points above Jaclyn, though, because she tries a little harder to keep the peace. ",

      "name": "Jaclyn",
      "actor": "Michelle Monaghan",
      "reasoning": "I don't even think we're supposed to like Jaclyn. Almost everything she says to and about her friends is either rude or narcisisstic. Out of the three in the friend group, she bothers me the most because she proves herself to be such a liar. It's hard to look past, and she never really seems to feel sorry for cheating or hurting her friends.  ",

      "name": "Zion",
      "actor": "Nicholas Duvernay",
      "reasoning": "Another character development issue. To the point where the character is often not believable because his actions don't have much apparent motivation. He pushes his mother into very uncomfortable and unsafe situations (cough, cough telling her to go over to Greg-Gary's house in the first place) and it makes absolutely no sense why.",

      "actor": "Sarah Catherine Hook",
      "reasoning": "I also feel like I know this person, so I'm biased in my assessment. I can't stand the fake thesis thing because it takes so much work to write one. That propelled her right to the bottom of the list. And itt's baffling to me that someone would trick their parents into flying them to Thailand to stay at the equivalent of the Four Seasons.
